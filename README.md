# redirection
redirect to a random mesa complex mirror whenever you connect - helps prevent being blocked

from what I know, schools (or at least my school) blocks links from keywords, traffic, and time spent. traffic isnt something we can do much about, but the other two are jukeable. by creating a bunch of different mirrors, and redirecting to a random mirror upon connection, it should trick schools districts into blocking the mirrors instead of the redirection site. this way, when a mirror gets blocked, we can just remove it without anyone knowing.
